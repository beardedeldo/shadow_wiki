# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) - Basic Combat Training (BCT)

## Overview

> **Trainers:** Ensure comprehension before advancing. Share SOPs with recruits for pre-BCT study.

### Game Master

> Set up the following stations near the main base with adequate spacing for jogging from location to location. 

1. Shooting Range.
2. Sandbag covers with down-range targets.
3. Four bunkers at 12, 9, 6, and 3 o'clock positions.
4. One bunker with 4 sandbag covers, 20-40m south.

# BCT 1: Communication and Formations

## Objective 1.0

Understand and utilize proper communication.

> Cover concepts, practice proximity and radio frequency communication, confirm understanding at main base (away from spawn).

## Communication Procedures and Formations

### 1. Communication Procedures

- **Green Comms:** Open communication.
- **Yellow Comms:** Restricted, subordinates request to speak.
- **Red Comms:** Closed communication, silence below Captain.

### 2. Radio Terminology

- **Break:** Clear comms.
- **Over:** End transmission.
- **Break:** Pause mid-transmission.
- **Out:** Close transmission.
- **How-Copy:** Confirm reception.
- **Copy:** Confirm understanding.
- **Come In:** Request response.
- **Standby:** Request pause.
- **Say Again:** Repeat transmission.

## Objective 1.1

Understand and utilize proper formations.

### 3. Patrol Formation

- **Visual:** Square with four members at corners.
- **Benefits:** All-round visibility, security, communication.
- **Use cases:** Patrolling, securing, reconnaissance.

### 4. File Formation

- **Visual:** Single line.
- **Benefits:** Efficient in narrow spaces, minimizes profile.
- **Use cases:** Passing obstacles, flanking, entering/exiting buildings.

### 5. Line Formation

- **Visual:** Shoulder-to-shoulder.
- **Benefits:** Firepower concentration, quick movement.
- **Use cases:** Assaults, open ground, covering flanks.

### 6. Wedge Formation

- **Visual:** V-shaped "arrowhead."
- **Benefits:** Penetration, focused firepower.
- **Use cases:** Breaking enemy lines, attacking, surprise attacks.

> **Trainers:** Confirm understanding and proceed to jogging to the shooting range for practical exercises.

1. Form teams, assign roles.
2. Trainer as Team Lead, call formations.
3. Use radio terminology during the jog.
4. Test knowledge with sudden stops and orders.

# BCT 2: Weapon Discipline, Smokes, Grenades, Flash Bangs

> **Trainers:** Demonstrate concepts at the shooting range.

## Objective 2.0

Learn weapon handling and usage.

## 1. Weapon Handling

- **Commands:** Raise/lower, low ready, inspect.

## 2. Weapon Fire Discipline

- **Concept:** Manage ammo, effective range.
- **Steps:** Controlled firing and burst patterns.

## 3. Aiming and Accuracy

- **Target:** "Box" on wooden targets.
- **Steps:** Controlled shots, wait for target to stand.

> **Trainers:** Test understanding, then proceed to next area with sandbags and targets.

## Objective 2.1

Learn grenade handling.

### Smoke Grenades

- **Purpose:** Create a smoke wall.
- **Communication:** Announce type and color.

### Fragmentation Grenades

- **Purpose:** Clear "Dead Zones."
- **Communication:** Announce type.

### Stun/Flash Bang Grenades

- **Purpose:** Distraction, disorientation.
- **Communication:** Announce type.

### Steps to Throw Any Grenade

1. Hold grenade.
2. Pull pin.
3. Aim.
4. Announce type loudly.
5. Release, take cover.

> **Trainers:** Confirm understanding, then proceed to the next section for react-to-contact and clock test.

# BCT 3: Clock System and React to Contact

> **Trainers:** Conduct exercises at the four bunkers location.

## Objective 3.0

React effectively to contact, apply CTA and SAL.

### 1. CTA (Cover, Think, Act)

- **Steps:** Seek cover, assess with SAL, respond decisively.

### 2. SAL (Size, Action, Location)

- **Steps:** Estimate enemy force, determine action, identify location.

### 3. Clock System

- **Use:** Accurately communicate enemy position using a clock face.

### 4. Direction & Coordinates

- **Use:** On-screen compass for directional and coordinate communication.

> **Trainers:** Conduct live fire exercise, grading recruits based on BCT knowledge.

# BCT 4 (Final Exam): Buddy Bounding and Close Quarter Combat (CQC)

## Objective 4.0

- Learn how to work as a team, move from cover to cover, and tactically clear enemies. 
> **Trainers:** This is a live fire excercise and you need to observe how well recruits have learned the previous concepts.  


### Buddy Bounding

> **Definition:** Buddy Bounding involves 2 or more members "bounding" from cover to cover, closing in on an enemy position while covering each other through suppression or vigilant lookout. Ensure safe transition between covers.

**Example:**
- "One man covering."
- "Two men moving."
- "Two men set and covering."
- "One man moving."
- "One man set."

> **Trainers:** allow recruits to use smoke grenades (optional). 

> **Trainers:** confirm Buddy Bounding concepts are well understood and then proceed to last location. 

### BCE: Close Quarter Combat Introduction: Breach, Clear, Exfil

> **Definition:**
- **Breach:** Gain entry into the target structure.
- **Clear:** Navigate through the structure, ensuring no enemy combatants remain.
- **Exfil:** Move to the structure exit, exit while forming a security perimeter. Use appropriate method to call for exfil (ping command, provide SITREP and CASREP, request exfil). 

**Example:**
- Make sure teams line up and confirm ready before breaching. "Team ready to breach? Four ready. Three ready. Two ready. Team ready to breach. One man breaching."

> **Trainers:** This phase integrates teamwork, movement, and tactical clearing. Emphasize effective communication and coordinated actions. Ensure recruits understand and can execute these concepts in simulated scenarios.
